last two columns the same so equivalent

not logically equivalent because last two columns different

>$r=$ 6 is a factor of n
>$(p \land q) \to r$, $p \lor q \lor r$

last column will always be true except F F F so not equivalent

> 20.
> a. $p \to q$, $p \land \lnot q$ P is a square and P is not a rectangle
> b. Today is New Year's Eve and tomorrow is not January
> c. The decimal expansion of r is terminating and r is not rational
> d. n is prime and n is not odd and n is not 2.
> e. x is nonnegative and x is not positive and x is not 0
> f. Tom is Ann's father and Jim is not her uncle or Sue is not her aunt
> g. n is divisible by 6 and n is not divisible by 2 or n is not divisible by 3

> 22.
> a. If p is not a rectangel then p is not a square
> b. If tomorrow is not January then today is not New Year's Eve
> c. If r is not rational then the decimal exparnsion of r is not terminating
> d. If n is not odd and n is not 2 then n is not prime
> e. If x is not positive and x is not 0 then x is negative
> f. If Jim is not her uncle or Sue is not her aunt then Tom is not Ann's father.
> g. If n is not divisible by 2 or n is not divisible by 3 then n is not divisible by 6.

> 23.
> a. If P is not a square then P is not a rectange
> b. If today is not New Year's Eve then tomorrow is not January
> c. If the decimal expansion of r is nonterminating then r is not rational

> f. If Tom is not Ann's father then Jim is not her uncle or Sue is not her aunt
> g. If n is not divisible by 6 then n is not divisible by 2 or n is not divisible by 3.
