## Systematics

The study of the diversity of life both past and present and looking at their relationships

### Phylogeny

"family tree" looking at how different organisms are related to one another and where they diverged

- To construct an accurate phylogeny, we can look at morphology (the physical structures of an organism) with a focus on homologous structures
- Can also look at genetics (DNA) to look for similarities and ancestry

- **Basal taxon** - first branch to diverge from the common ancestor (likely the closest relative to the common ancestor)
- **Sister taxa** - two closely related organisms that share a common ancestor
- **Ancestral character** - a character that originated from the common ancestor and is shared by all of its descendants.
- **Derived character** - a character that is unique to a particular group of organism
- **Monophyletic clade** - a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants (best)
- **Paraphyletic clade** - a group that consists of a common ancestor and most but not all of its descendants
- **Polyphyletic clade** - a group that includes organisms that don't share a direct common ancestor (bad)

## Bacteria

**Genetic Variation** - bacteria produce by binary fission (basically mitosis) - asexual reproduction
Maintain genetic variation by:

1. **Mutation** - random changes in the DNA sequence - often occurs during division - bacteria produce so fast, they have a higher chance for mutations to occur
2. **Transduction** - viral phage releases its genetic material into a bacterium and by random chance, DNA from a previous bacteria host also got incorporated - the new host may actually gain that DNA from the virus

3. **Transformation** - bacteria can take up foreign DNA from the environment and incorporate it into their own genome
4. **Conjugation** - donor bacteria with an F plasmid can form a sex pilus (mating bridge) that attaches to a recipient bacterium and a plasmid is transferred from the donor to the recipient through the sex pilus

### Modes of nutrition

**Photoautotrophs** - utilize light energy for their energy source, can create their own organic carbon from inorganic carbon ($CO_2$)

- plants
- algae
- photosynthesis

**Chemotoautotrophs** - utilize chemical energy for their energy source, create organic carbon from $CO_2$

- bacteria found at the deep sea trenches

**Photoheterotrophs** - utilize light energy, but they need to get their organic carbon from an external source (very rare and only seen in some prokaryotes)
**Chemoheterotrophs** - utilizes chemical energy and obtains organic carbon from an external source

- animals

**Nitrogen** - important for life but difficult to access because $N_2$ is not very reactive. To get access to nitrogen, you need nitrogen fixation

- $N_2 \to NH_3$
- Often have nitrogen fixing bacteria
- Cyanobacteria often form a mutualistic interaction with a nitrogen fixing bacteria (heterocyst) where the heterocyst gives the cyanobacteria access to N and the cyanobacteria gives the hererocyst energy

### Bacteria Diversity

1. **Phylum Proteobacteria** - extremely dierse group, includes photoautotrophs, chemoautotrophs, and chemoheterotrophs. All members are gram-negative (pink), many are pathogens

2. **Phylum Chlamydias** - all parasites inside animal cells
   - causes a lot of diseases
3. **Phylum Spirochetes** - spiral shaped bacteria, also parasitic - causes Lyme disease

4. **Phylum Cyanobacteria** - photosynthetic bacteria (possibly the first photosynthetic organism), often form a chain-like colony and also have a symbiotic heterocyst. Some have separation disks that break off and allow the colony to multiply
   ![[../../Discrete Math/Notes/attachments/cyanobacteria.png]]
5. Phylum Firmicutes - Gram-positive bacteria (purple), most are decomposers and pathogens
   ![[../../Discrete Math/Notes/attachments/firmicutes_ex.png]]
   - actinobacteria that releases geosmin that gives the "rain smell" - soil dwelling decomposers

### Domain Archaea

- prokaryotes that are very similar to bacteria
- cell walls lack peptidoglycan
- all are extremophiles

1. **Phylum Korachaeotes** - exclusively thermophiles - often found in hydrothermal vents or hot springs
2. **Phylum Euryarchaeotes** - strictly anaerobic - they are poisoned by oxygen, include methanogens that live in marshes that release methane, other members live in anaerobic environments
3. **Phylum Crenarchaeotes** - thermophiles that are often found in deep sea or volcanic springs.
   - Sulfalobus serves as a model organism to study archaens because they can actually be contained in a lab
4. **Phylum Nanoarchaeotes** - the smallest archaean, only one species and it is symbiotic to another archaean found in hydrothermal vents
