# Unit 1 Study Guide

- Darwin
	- Evolution is "descent with modification"
	- The mechanism for evolution is natural selection
	- Aristotle
		- Believed all species are created by god and "are perfect and permanent"
		- Created latter system to clasify organizms hierarchically by complexity
	- Linneaus
		- Created a system to categorize species by nested system
	- Fossils
		- Cuvier
			- Father of paleontology: the study of fossils
			- Catastrophism suggests extinction events in earths history resulted in boundaries of fossil layers
		- Fossil record as timeline
	- Hutton
		- Gradualism suggested evolution happened slowly over time rather than suddenly
	- Lyell
		- Uniformitarianism suggests the same natural laws always existed
	- Malthus
		- "Organisms produce more offspring than the environment can support"
		- Suggests competition because of limited resources
	- Lamarck
		- Use and disuse of body parts
		- Inheritance of acquired characteristics
	- Wallace
		- Came up with same theory as Darwin but Darwin published first
	- Adaptation
		- Organisms that have traits to enhance their survivability in an environment.
		- Leads to specialization
		- Results from competition and limited resources
	- Darwin's simple argument
		- Observations
			- Members of a population often vary in their inherited traits
			- All species can produce more offspring than the environment can support, and many of these offspring fail to survive or reproduces
		- Inferences
			- Individuals who inherited traits give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals
			- This unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce will lead to the accumulation of favorable traits in the population over generations
	- Natural selection
		- Individuals do not evolve, populations do
		- Can only increase or decrease heritable traits that vary in a population
		- Does not create new traits, but edits or selects for traits already present in the population
		- The current, local environment determines which traits will be selected for or selected agains in any specific population
	- Evidence of evolution
		- Direct observations
			- Soapberry bug beak length differs based on size of fruit they feed on
			- Drug resistant bacteria *Staphylococcus aureus*
		- Homology
			- Similarity resulting from common ancestry
			- Homologous structures are anatomical resemblances that represent variations on a structural theme present in a common ancestor
				![[../../Discrete Math/Notes/attachments/Screen Shot 2021-09-25 at 11.44.17 AM 1.png]]
				- Vestigial structures are remnants of features that served important functions in the organism's ancestors
			- Analogous structures look alike but did not evolve from the same ancestry
				- Convergent evolution is the evolution of similar, or analogous, features in distantly related groups
				- Does not provide information about ancestry
				- Arise when independent adaptation occurs in similar environments
		- Fossil record
			- Provides evidence of the extinction of species, the origin of new groups, and changes within groups over time
			- Documents important transitions
		- Biogeography
			- The scientific study of the geographic distributions of species
			- Endemic species are species not found anywhere else in the world
		- Speciation
			- A group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed in nature and produce viable, fertile offspring; they do not breed successfully with members of other populations
			- Reproductive isolation is the existence of biological factors that impede two species from producing viable, fertile offspring
			- Reproductive barriers
				- Prevents two species from interbreeding successfully
				- Prezygotic
					- Habitat isolation
						- Species occupy different habitats
					- Temporal isolation
						- Species breed at different times of the day, seasons, or years
					- Behavioral isolation
						- Courtship rituals and other unique behaviors
					- Mechanical isolation
						- Morphological differences
					- Gametic isolation
						- Sperm of one species may not be able to fertilize eggs of another
				- Postzygotic
					- Reduced hybrid viability
						- Genes of the different parent species may interact and impair the hybrid's development or survival in its environment
					- Reduced hybrid fertility
						- Hybrids may be sterile
						- Donkey + Horse = Mule (sterile)
					- Hybrid breakdown
						- Some first-generation hybrids are fertile, but when they mate with each other or with either parent species, offspring of the next generation are feeble or sterile
	- Mendel
		- Proved existence of genes using pea plants
	- Genetic variation
		- Caused by differences in genes or other DNA segments
		- Important for producing adaptations in a changing environment
		- Causes
			- Mutations
				- Gene duplication
				- Deceasing generation time (more cell division)
			- Sexual reproduction
				- Shuffles existing alleles into new combinations
				- More important for adaptations than mutation in sexually reproducing organisms
	- Hardy-Weinberg Equation
		- Tests if a population is evolving
		- $p^2+2pq+q^2=1$
		- If equal to 1 then population is **not** evolving
		- Five conditions for non-evolving populations
			- No mutations
			- Random mating
			- No natural selection
			- Extremely large population size
			- No gene flow
	- Genetic drift
		- Founder effect
			- Occurs when a small subset of a population emmigrates and thus decreases the gene pool
		- Bottleneck effect
			- Some event reduces the population size which reduces the gene pool
	- Gene flow
		- Transfer of genetic material from one population to another.
		- Genetic pollution occurs when the genetic material of one population (immigrants) have traits that are not adaptable to the new population
	- Natural selection
		- Not random and consistently results in adaptations
		- Directional
			- Favors $\pm 50$th percentile
		- Disruptive
			- Favors both extremes
		- Stabilizing
			- Favors average
		- ![[../../Discrete Math/Notes/attachments/Pasted image 20210925123628.png]]
	- Speciation
		- Allopatric
			- Geographically isolated populations
			- Each population has their own mutations
		- Sympatric
			- Geographically overlapping
			- Habitat differentiation
				- Focus on different resources
			- Sexual selection
				- Certain sexual preferences
	- How is the fossil record biased?
		- Soft bodied organisms don't leave a trace
		- Rare organisms likely not preserved / low chance of being found

| 1.2 bya | origin of multicellular organisms - all cells need some way to adhere to each other, cells need to be able to communicate with one another and function as a whole                                                                                              |

| 488 mya | life moved on to land - with the exception of bacteria plants and fungi likely moved onto land first                                                                                                                                                            |
| 250 mya | permian extinction - caused by a lot of volcanic eruptions which polluted the atmosphere, very toxic gasses accumulated such as methane, hyrdogen sulfide, and $CO_2$ - approximately 96% of life went extinct (mostly marine life)                             |
| 65 mya  | cretaceous extinction - wiped out the dinosaurs - a large meteorite hit the planet - the impact wiped out a large amount of life, but the aftermath where a lot of debris blocked off sunlight led the global climate changes - this led to the mass extinction | 

- Endosymbiont theory - origin of eukaryotic organelles is likely where a larger eukaryotic cell engulfed a smaller prokaryote and the prokaryote became a mutual simbiote permanently living inside
