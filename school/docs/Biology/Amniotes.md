-   All members have extraembryonic membranes
-   **Amniotic Egg**: Has a shell (highly waterproof and UV protection), yolk
    provides nutrients
-   Scales made of keratin to prevent dehydration
-   Expandable ribcage helps for ventilation of lungs

### Class Reptilia

-   Tough skin with keratin scales that help resist dehydration
-   Have amniotic egg with a soft leathery shell
-   Ectothermic: Cold-blooded animals need to rely on the environment to help
    regulate their body temperatures
-   Most members have a 3.5 chambered heart
    -   Two atria and one ventricle that is partially split in half by a septum

#### Clade Tuatara

-   A group of reptiles that look like lizards but come from a separate
    evolutionary branch
-   Only about 2 species left endemic to New Zealand

#### Order Squamata

-   Includes the lizards and the snakes

#### Order Testudine

-   Includes the turtles and tortoises
-   ALl members have boxlike shell with two halves
    -   Dorsal
    -   Ventral
-   Turtles are often aquatic and have webbed feet
-   Tortoises are completely terrestrial and have hooved feet

#### Order Crocodilia

-   Includes alligators, crocodiles, and caimans
-   All members are large aquatic predators

### Class Aves

-   Birds
-   Technically feathered reptiles
-   Benefits of flight
    -   Escape predators
    -   Findidng resources
    -   Finding mates
    -   Migration
    -   Being able to live in different environments
    -   3D world
    -   Allows them to eat flying insects
-   Costs of flight
    -   Lots of enegry expenditure
-   Flying efficiency
    -   Smaller bodies to reduce weight
    -   Less bone density - hollow bones
    -   Loss of some organs - no urinary bladder
    -   Pooping helps reduce weight
    -   Feathers are modified scales made of b-keratin
    -   Large and strong chest muscles to aid flight
    -   4-chambered heart - much more oxygen effecient
    -   Endothermic: Warm-blooded which alllows them to use metabolic heat to
        regulate their body temperatures

#### Order Falconiformes

-   Hawks and falcons
-   All diurnal predators
-   Talons to capture prey and curved beaks to tear flesh

#### Order Strigiformes

-   Owls
-   Nocturnal predators
-   Binocular vision

#### Order Psittaciformes

-   Parrots
-   Extremely intelligent
-   Strong curved beaks designed to crack open seeds
-   Can mimic sounds and are highly social

### Class Mammalia

-   Milk production helps nourish developing babies
-   Hair helps with temperature regulation
