## Historical Figures

**Darwin**
: First to publish the theory of evolution.
: Evolution is "descent with modification".
: The mechanism for evolution is natural selection.

**Aristotle**
: Believed all species are created by god and "are perfect and permanent".
: Created a latter system to classify organisms hierarchically by complexity.

**Linneaus**
: Created a system to categorize species by nested system.

**Fossils**
: Remains of organisms from the past that are trapped in sedimentary rock layers called strata.
: The layers of strata function like a timeline that shows evolutionary changes.
: The further down a fossil is found the older it is.

**Georges Cuvier**
: Came up with paleontology, the study of fossils.
: Developed the theory of catastrophism which suggests throughout earth's history there were several sudden changes caused by natural disasters that led to extinction events and that resulted in the boundary of each layer of fossil.

**James Hutton**
: Developed the theory of gradualism which suggests that evolution and the history of life on earth happend gradually instead of suddenly.
: Change is slow, constant, and consistent.

**Charles Lyell**
: Developed the theory of uniformitarianism which suggests the same natural laws that govern earth today (gravity, etc.) existed back in history.

**Thomas Malthus**
: Studied human suffering and suggested that most of human suffering is due to the fact that there are more humans than resources available and that results in competition.
: Winners and losers where losers suffer or die.

**Lamarck**
: Came up with a hypothesis to describe the mechanism of evolution however with modern evidence it is incorrect.
: Use and disuse of body parts
: - The more a body part is used the bigger and stronger it gets.
: - The less a part is used the weaker and smaller it gets.
: Inheritance of acquired characteristics

**Alfred Russel Wallace**
: Russian scientist that came up with same theory as Darwin but was slower to publish so Darwin received all the credit.

## Darwin's Argument

**Adaptations**
: Some sort of characteristic that enhances an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in a particular environment.

- Observations
  - Members of a population often vary in their inherited traits.
    - All species can produce more offspring than the environment can support, and many of these offspring fail to survive or reproduces.
- Inferences
  - Individuals who inherited traits give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals.
    - This unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce will lead to the accumulation of favorable traits in the population over generations.

## Natural Selection

- Individuals do not evolve, populations do.
- Can only increase or decrease heritable traits that vary in a population.
- It does not create new traits, but edits or selects for traits already present in the population.
  - The current, local environment determines which traits will be selected for or against in any specific population.

## Evidence of Evolution

### Direct observations

- Soapberry bug beak length differs based on size of fruit they feed on.
  - Drug resistant bacteria _Staphylococcus aureus_.

### Homology

Similarity resulting from common ancestry.

**Homologous structures**
: Anatomical resemblances that represent variations on a structural theme present in a common ancestor.

**Vestigial structures**
: Remnants of features that served important functions in the organism's ancestors.

**Analogous structures**
: Features that look alike but did not evolve from the same ancestry.

**Convergent evolution**
: The evolution of similar, or analogous features in distantly related groups.
: Does not provide information about ancestry.
: Arise when independent adaptation occurs in similar environments.

### Fossil record

Provides evidence of the extinction of species, the origin of new groups, and changes within groups over time.

Documents important transitions.
