## Traits

-

### Subphylum Urochordata

-   Free-swimming larva and sessile filter feeding adult that uses siphons to
    filter water

### Clade Craniates

-   Development of a skull and a well defined head
-   Neural crest that gave rise to the skull and sensory organs found in the
    head
-   Better developed brain
-   Pharyngeal clefts function as gills
-   Active lifestyle = more muscularization and higher metabolic rates
-   Heart with at least 2 chambers

#### Class Myxini

-   Hagfish
-   Skull is made of cartilage
-   Simple sensory structures
-   Eat dead/decaying animals
-   No jaws or vertebral column

### Clade Vertebrates

-   Have a vertebral column
-   Notochord wraps around the nerve cord and becomes the vertebral column
-   Dorsal fins show up to help with mobility and reduce water drag

#### Class Petromyzontida

-   Lampreys
-   Jawless
-   Has a suction cup mouth part with teeth made of cartilage
-   Blood parasites: latch onto a large host and use a rasping tongue to poke a
    hole and drink blood
-   Vertebral column is made of cartilage

### Clade Gnathostomes

-   Jawed chordates: hinged jaw
-   Originated from the fusion of pharyngeal slit bones with the mouth
-   True bone (mineralized) teeth
-   More advanced sensory structures
-   Paired fins (pectoral and pelvic fins) for sharper turns
-   **Lateral line system**: Sensory organ with hairs that allow aquatic members
-   Originated around 450 mya to detect minor changes in vibration in the water

#### Class Chondrichthyes

-   Sharks, rays, ratfish/chimera
-   Skeleton made of cartilage
-   Streamlined body
-   **Denticles**: sharp and rough scales that also help reduce drag
-   Lateral line system
-   **Ampullae of Lorenzini**: Jelly filled sensory organs at the nose that
    allow sharks to detect electrical impulses

#### Rays

-   Pelvic and pectoral fins fused to form large flaps that allow them to glide
    at the sea floor and hunt down mollusks and crustaceans
-   Have a thin long tail with a barbed stinger

#### Ratfish/Chimera

-   Usually found in deeper parts of the ocean
-   Primarily a scavenger
-   Chondrichthyes lack a swim bladder so to control buoyancy they need to
    constantly be swimming

### Clade Osteichthyes

-   Skeleton made of calcium phosphate (true bone)
-   Members have either a swim bladder or lungs
-   Swim bladder is designed to control buoyancy

#### Class Actinopterygii

-   Bony fish
-   Highly diverse group
-   Have a true bony skeleton
-   **Operculum**: Flap that protects the gills
-   Have smooth and flat cycloid scalles insteadd of the denticles

#### Class Sarcopterygii

-   Lobe-fin fishes
-   Includes coelacanths and lung fish
-   Have extra skeletal and muscular support at their pectoral and pelvic fins
-   Limited ability to breathe oxygen from ouside of water

### Clade Tetrapods

-   4 limbs with digits
-   Neck for movement of the head
-   Fusion of pelvic gridle with backbone
-   Pharyngeal clefts become ears
-   No gills
-   Lungs develop from the swim bladder

#### Class Amphibia

-   Salamanders, frogs/toads, caecilians
-   3 chambered hearts (2 atria and 1 ventricle)
-   Gas exchange occurs through skin and drinking water is also through the skin
-   Tied to water due to water fertilization and aquatic larva (tadpoles) that
    eventually metamorphosize into the terrestrial adults
-   No drought resistance, so they have to live in moist environments or be
    completely aquatic
-   Eggs have no protection-they just have a layer of jelly
-   Emergence of parental care including transporting young to a better
    environment

##### Order Urodela

-   Salamnders
-   Most basal member of the amphibians
-   Not very fast in mobility
-   They have to wobble back and forth similar to a fish to move

##### Order Anura

-   Frogs
-   Much more mobile than salamanders
-   Have elongated and strong hind legs that allow them to jump very far
-   Tongue is located at the tip of the mouth instead of inside that throat
-   All predatory
-   Some can be toxic EX: poison dart frog

##### Order Apoda

-   Caecilians
-   Legless amphibians-look like a worm
-   Soil dwellers that eat other soil dwellers
