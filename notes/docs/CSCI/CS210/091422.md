## Array vs Linked List

-   Array memory allocation is contiguous
-   Linked list uses pointers, memory is scattered

### Array

#### Advantages

-   Reading at a position is more efficient with an array

### Linked List

#### Advantages

-   Insertion and deletion is more efficient with linked list

## NP Complete, NP Hard

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! question "Nondeterministic Polynomial - NP"
    There could exist a ploynomial time complexity, but currently unknown

### Graph Coloring

### Traveling Salesman

-   Traverse all locations exactly once, then return to origin
-   Shortest path is NP Hard

## Algorithm Efficiency

### Linear Search

-   Best case 1
-   Worst case $n$

### Binary Search

-   Cuts search space in half every iteration
-   Worse case $log(n)$

### Merge Sort

-   Worse case $nlog(n)$

## Constant vs Non Constant Operations

### Constant

-   Assignment
-   Multiplication

### Non Constant

```cpp
for (i=0; i<x; i++) {
  sum +=y
}
```

## Growth of Functions and Complexity

$T(N)=7N+36$

derivative = 7

$T(N)=7N^2+36N+10$

## Big-O Notation

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! info "Rules"
    1. If $f(N)$ is a sum of several terms, the highest order term is kept and
       others are discarded.
    2. If $f(N)$ has a term that is a product of several factors, all constants are
       omitted.

```cpp
maxVal = numbers[0]
for (i=0; i<N; ++i) {
  if (numbers[i] > maxVal) {
    maxVal = numbers[i]
  }
}
```

| Line    | Complexity   |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 1       | 1            |
| 2       | 1            |
| 3       | N iterations |
| 3 `i<N` | 1            |
| 3 `++i` | 1            |
