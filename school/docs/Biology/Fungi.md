## Introduction

**Fungi anatomy** - most of the fungus's body is in the form of an extensive filament network called mycelium, which has extremely high surface area to absorb nutrients.

**Coenocytic hypha/mycelium** - mycelium is multinucleate. Technically, one cell with lots of nuclei interflowing (usually seen in earlier groups of fungi).

**Septate hypha/mycelium** - mycelium that are multicellular with <u>cell walls called septa that separate each cell</u>. Septa have large openings in them that allow nuclei to flow through (usually seen in more advanced groups of fungi)
- Main advantage is they can shut off certain parts of their body.
- Slower transfer of nutrients.

**Mycorrhizal fungi** -

## Fungi Life Cycle
**Plasmogamy** - The fusion of the cytoplasm between two different individual fungi mycelium. This results in an n+n ploidy (heterokaryotic or dikaryotic)
- For coenocytic hypha, the result will be heterokayotic. Multiple different haploid nuclei flowing in the same mycelium.
- For septate hypha, the result will be hikaryotic. Each cell in the hypha will have one of each of the two different haploid nuclei.

**Karyogamy** - The fusion of the haploid nuclei. The two different types of nuclei in the mycelium will now fuse together to form a diploid zygote.

**Molds** - Asexually reproducing fungi that spread through asexual sporangia and spreading their mycelium

**Yeasts** - Unicellular asexually reproducing fungi. Reproduce through budding (mitosis).

## Fungi Diversity

>Most likely an ancestral protist in the group of Nuclearids gave rise to the first fungus - 420mya.

**Phylum Chytridomycota** - The most basal member of the fungi and strongly resemble the nuclearids.
- Typical anatomy of a fungus, but chytrid spores have flagella.
- BD which is a parasite that infects amphibian skin led to mass extinction of many amphibian species.
- Coenocytic/heterokaryotic n+n
	
**Phylum Zygomycota** - Primarily molds - e.g. bread mold.
- Zygosporangium is highly resilient. Usually it is only produced (sexual phase) when the environment is stressfull.
- Will remain dormant and only germinate into new sporangia when conditions are met.
-  Coenocytic - heterokaryotic n+n.

**Phylum Glomeromycota** - 
- The least diverse among fungi.
- Almost all are mycorrhizae fungi (symbiotic relationship with plant roots).
- Coenocytic - heterokaryotic n+n.

**Phylum Ascomycota** -
- The most diverse group of fungi and it includes unicellular yeasts, some molds, and elaborate mushroom-like bodies.
- They contain their spores in sacs called asci which are condensed into a fruiting body called an ascocarp.
- For the asexual life cycle, they have chains of spores called conidia that grow out of specialized hyphae called conidiophores.
