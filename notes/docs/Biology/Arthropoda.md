## Phylum Onychophora

-   Known as the velvet/walking worms.
-   Have a cuticle that they molt out of.
-   They are predators that use slime to trap prey.

## Phylum Tardigrada

-   Known as the water bears/moss piglets.
-   Extremely resilient animals that can go into a tun statecalled anhydorbiosis where it shuts down metabolism and remains dormant and resistant to any sort of stress

## Phylum Arthropoda

-   Bilateral
-   Triploblastic
-   Open gut
-   True coelom (only surrounded by mesoderm)
-   Hard exoskeleton
    -   Waterproof and helps the animal retain water
    -   Provides structural support against gravity
    -   Allowed arthropods to move onto land first (450 mya)
-   Segmentation and jointed appendages
    -   Segments can be specialized for different functions
    -   Joints allow for flexible movement while inside a hard exoskeleton
-   Advanced sensory structures
    -   hairs that can sense vibrations
    -   Antenna for smell
    -   Eyes with extremely good vision
-   Open circulatory system
    -   Circulatory system that doesn't contain circulatory fluid inside closed pipes, instead the
-   Respiratory organs
    -   Aquatic animals use gills, insects use tracheal tubes that go through the entire body and open at the abdomen called spiracles
    -   Chelicerates use book lungs

### Class Trilobita

-   Extinct group of arthropods that were likely really abundant during the Cambrian era
-   Likely bottom dwellers that fed on dead matter or fildered through mud/soil
-   Probably were capable of rolling up for defense

##### Class Merostomata

-   Horseshoe crabs
-   Morphology hasn't changed since the Triassic making them a "living fossil"

##### Class Arachnida

-   Includes the spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites
-   All members are parasitic or predators

---

#### Subphylum Myriapoda

Long arthropods with many legs and segments.

##### Class Chilopoda

-   Centipedes
-   Active predators with venom claws at their head
-   Bodies are dorsal ventrally flattened
-   Each segment has one pair of legs

##### Class Diplopoda

-   Millipedes
-   Herbivores that usually eat dead plant matter
-   Bodies are more robust/cylindrical
-   Each Segment has two pairs of legs

---

#### Subphylum Hexapoda

Arthropods with six legs

##### Class Insecta

-   The most diverse group of all animals (75% of animal diversity)
-   Flight in insects allow them to interact in a 3D world and have access to more resources, travel further, move faster, and escape predators.
-   Another reason insects are so diveres is because of their coevolution and specialization with plants (specifically flowering plants)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note "Anatomy"
    Have a head, thorax, abdomen, one pair of antenna, and usually one or two pairs of wings

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note "Metamorphosis"
    Transition from a baby into an adult
    **Complete Metamorphosis**
    : hello

    **Incomplete Metamorphosis**
    : - There is no larva stage, the baby already resembles the adult but just smaller, called a nymph
    : - With each molt, they get bigger and bigger and after the final molt, they have functional wings

    - Order Coleoptera
        - Beetles (CM)
    - Order Diptera
        - Flies (CM)

        - True bugs (IM)
    - Order Orthoptera
        - Crickets, katydids, grasshoppers (IM)

#### Subphylum Crustacea

-   Mostly aquatic arthropods
-   Most members have a distinct larva stage called a nauplius larva (crab-like)
-   Usually have a calcium carbonate shell

##### Class Maxillopoda

-   Barnacles
-   Larva are free swimming
-   Adults are sessile filter feeders
-   Adults secrete a hard calcium carbonate shell around their bodies and their legs are modified into filter feeding structures

##### Class Malacostraca

-   Decapods, krill, and isopods
-   Decapoda
    -   Includes crabs, lobsters, and shripm
    -   4 pairs of legs and a pair of pinchers (5 pairs of limbs)
    -   5 pairs, Deca = 10
