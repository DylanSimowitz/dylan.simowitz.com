## Protists

#### Protists
- Eukaryotes - extremely large for a single cell, they have a nucleus, membrane bound organelles
- Clade - a group of organisms that includes a common ancestor and all of its descendants
- Protist - a eukaryote that isn't a plant, animal, or fungus
	- originated about 1.8 bya - endosymbion theory a eukaryotic organism engulfed other prokaryotes and they became endosymbionts to the eukaryote. Much of the protist diversity came from secondary endosymbiosis where an even larger eukaryote ungulfs another eukaryote that already had an endosymbiont
	- Many protists go through secondary simbiosis 
	
#### Supergroup Excavata
> All members have flagella, they have a unique cytoskeletal structure, many members have an excavated feeding groove, includes free-living organisms, mutualists, and parasites
- Class Parabasalid - all have flagella surrounding their bodies - include mutualists and parasites
	- Triconympha - mutualist that permanently lives inside termite guts and help termites digest wood.
	- Phylum Euglenozoa - all members have a spiral crystalline rod structure inside of their flagella
		- Class Kinetoplastida - contain a single large mitochondria that contains a large portion of their DNA. E.g. Trypanosoma - blood parasite that eventually infects the nervous system causing sleeping sickness, about a third of their genome is dedicated to chaninging surface proteins
