1. a
2. a
3. For any integer n, $n^2-2$ is not divisible by 4

   Suppose not. Assume that $n$ is an integer and $n^2-2$ is divisible by 4.

   $\exists k : n^2-2=4k$
   $n^2=2+4k$
   $n^2=2(2k+1)$
   $n=\sqrt{2(2k+1)}$

   An odd ($2k+1$) multiplied by an even (2) is never a perfect square, so $n$ is a noninteger.

   > By contradiction, $n^2-2$ is not divisible by 4.

4. If $a,b,c$ are integers such that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ then at least $a$ or $b$ is even.
   Suppose not. Assume that $a$ and $b$ are odd numbers and $a^2+b^2=c^2$

   $\exists k_1: a=2k_1+1$, $\exists k_2: b=2k_2+1$
   $(2k_1+1)^2+(2k_2+1)^2=c^2$
   ${4k_1}^2+4k_1+1+{4k_{2}}^2+4k_2+1=c^2$
   $({4k_1}^2+4k_1+{4k_{2}}^2+4k_2)+2=c^2$
   $4({k_1}^2+k_1+{k_{2}}^2+k_2)+2=c^2$
   $4k+2=c^2$
   $c^2=2(2k+1)$
   $c=\sqrt{2(2k+1)}$

   An odd ($2k+1$) multiplied by an even (2) is never a perfect square, so $c$ is a noninteger.

   > By contradiction, $a$ or $b$ is even
